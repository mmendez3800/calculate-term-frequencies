This is a compilation of programs to practice and understand text frequency calculation using different languages

## Technologies
The programs in this project were run using the following:
* Node.js 12.22
* Python 3.9

## Setup
After cloning or forking the repository, you can run any of the programs through the command line in the below manner:
1. You will want to `cd` into the repository
2. Run the file desired and specify the text file you wish to parse
   - An example of running a JavaScript file would be `node no_style.js pride-and-prejudice.txt`
   - An example of running a Python file would be `python3 no_style.py`
